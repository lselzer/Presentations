Using GPUs to improve the computational efficiency of Gaussian process models

Gaussian processes are central to a huge number of statistical and machine learning models, including everything from spatial / spatio-temporal model to non-parametric regression to model selection. However, the use of Gaussian processes can be problematic for large data sets due to the computational complexity of evaluating and manipulating large covariance matrices. In this talk we will present recent work on two different applied spatial modeling problems: the first a spatial assignment model for migratory song birds, and the second a joint spatio-temporal model of fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) and its constituent species. For both projects we will discuss the general modeling approach and the nature of the computational bottlenecks that arose along the way. While these bottlenecks cannot be eliminated, their impact can be lessened through the use of commodity GPU hardware and existing GPU software libraries where appropriate. With relatively minor changes to existing code bases it is possible to see 2x - 5x performance improvements over well tuned CPU only implementations. We will conclude with a discussion of where these approaches fit within the larger context of efficient / approximate Gaussian process methods.
