Teaching R using the github ecosystem

In this talk we will discuss an R based Master's level statistical computing course taught for the first time at Duke University in the Fall of 2014. The talk will focus on ways in which statisticians can adopt the tools and best practices of software engineers and other working practictioners to teach and improve the computing abilities of our students. We will focus in particular on the adoption of github and connected services like Travis-CI as a platform for teaching students how to produce R based analyses that are of high quality, reproducible, and throughly tested while working in a team-based collaborative environment. We will discuss in detail course structure and logistics as well as give examples from the case studies used in the course.
