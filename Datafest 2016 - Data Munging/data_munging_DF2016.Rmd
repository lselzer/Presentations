# Set up & Configuration

## Datasets, presentation, source code

- That data we will be using today is available via the `nycflights13` package.

    - In R, run 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nycflights13")
```

<br/>

- The slides and all source files for this presentation can be found at

## Welcome to the Hadleyverse

For today's session we will be using a number of R packages that have been developed by Hadley Wickham.

All of these packages are available on CRAN, before starting we want to make sure that everyone is using the most current available versions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("dplyr","readr","magrittr"))
```

<br/>

Also - now is a good time to check that your version of R is up-to-date. If you are not running version 3.2.3 or later it is time to update. After updating R be sure to also update your packages.


# readr

## readr

This is a recent package that is designed to be a fast and friendly way of reading tabular data into R.

<br/>

Core features:

* Faster than base R (~4x)
* No strings as factors
* No column name mangling
* Consistent argument/function naming scheme
* Plays nice with dplyr (`tbl_df`)
* Progress bars


## Example (csv) {.smaller}


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
(mtcars = read_csv(system.file("extdata/mtcars.csv", package = "readr")))
```

## {.smaller}

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

## {.smaller}

```{r}
(mtcars = read_csv(system.file("extdata/mtcars.csv.zip", package = "readr")))
```

# Pipes

## magrittr {.smaller}


<div class="centered">
<img src="imgs/magritte.jpg" height="175px" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="imgs/magrittr.jpeg" height="175px" />
</div>

This is an idea that has been around for a long time - particularly in the unix ecosystem. 

* Complex tasks can be accomplished by stringing together many simple tools - syntax is important for efficiency / readability

* The idea of pipes is that the result of the previous command is passed to the next command, which allows many tools to be strung together - from left to right.

* In R, Magrittr introduces the `%>%` pipe operator which runs the expression of the left and passes the result as the *first* argument to expression on the right.

 
## An example {.smaller}

You can think about the following sequence of actions we want to perform:

* find key
* start car with keys
* drive car to campus
* park car

Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:

```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to="campus"))
```

Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) structure:

```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
    start_car() %>%
    drive(to="campus") %>%
    park()
```

## Approaches {.smaller}

All of the following are fine, it amounts to preference.

<br/>

Nested:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
h( g( f(x), y=1), z=1 )
```

Piped:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
f(x) %>% g(y=1) %>% h(z=1)
```

Intermediate:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
res = f(x)
res = g(res, y=1)
res = h(res, z=1)
```

## What about other arguments? {.smaller}

Sometimes we want to send our results to a function argument *other* than first one or we want to use the previous result for multiple arguments. In these cases we refer to the previous result using `.`.

```{r}
data.frame(a=1:3,b=3:1) %>% lm(a~b,data=.)
data.frame(a=1:3,b=3:1) %>% .[[1]]
data.frame(a=1:3,b=3:1) %>% .[[length(.)]]
```

# dplyr

## A Grammar of Data Manipulation {.smaller}

dplyr is based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames.

Single data frame functions / verbs:

* `tbl_df()`: add the `tbl_df` class to a data frame
* `filter()`: pick rows matching given criteria
* `slice()`: pick rows by index(es)
* `select()`: pick columns by name
* `rename()`: rename column(s)
* `arrange()`: sort / reorder row(s)
* `mutate()`: add new variables / columns
* `transmute()`: create new data frame
* `distinct()`: filter for unique rows
* `sample_n()` / `sample_frac()`: randomly sample rows
* `summarise()`: reduce variables to values
* `group_by()`: indicates values to group by when summarizing


## dplyr rules

* First argument is a data frame

* Subsequent arguments say what to do with data frame

* Always return a data frame

* Don't modify in place


## Example Data {.smaller}

```

## Examples

1. Which destinations have the highest average delays?

1. Which plane (check the tail number) flew out of each New York airport the most?


## Exercises - Part 1

1. What was the shortest flight out of each airport in terms of distance? In terms of duration?

1. Which date should you fly on if you want to have the lowest possible average depature delay? What about arrival delay?

1. How many flights to Los Angeles (LAX) did each of the legacy carriers (AA, UA, DL or US) have in May from JFK, and what was their average duration?


# Merging Data

## A Grammar of Data Manipulation (cont.)

Two table functions / verbs, all functions have the form `f(a,b)`:

* `left_join` - Join matching rows from `b` to `a`, preserving all rows of `a`
* `right_join` - Join matching rows from `a` to `b`, preserving all rows of `b`.
* `inner_join` - Join data, preserving only rows with keys in both `a` and `b`.
* `full_join` - Join data, preserving all rows in both `a` and `b`.
* `semi_join` - Subset rows in `a` that have a match in `b`.
* `anti_join` - Subset rows in `a` that do not have a match in `b`.

## Example - Enhancing NYC Flights

The `nycflights13` package also contains additional information about

* `weather` - hourly meterological data for each airport
* `planes` - construction information about each plane
* `airports` - airport names and locations
* `airlines` - translation between two letter carrier codes and names

## Weather and flight delays {.smaller}

Lets take a quick look at the weather data, with an eye towards examining how it might affect things like flight departure delays,

```{r}
weather
```


## Join by? {.smaller}

Weather column definitions:

* `origin` - Weather station. Named origin to faciliate merging with flights data
* `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour` - Time of recording
* `temp`, `dewp` - Temperature and dewpoint in F
* `humid` - Relative humidity
* `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust` - Wind direction (in degrees), speed and gust speed (in mph)
* `precip` - Preciptation, in inches
* `pressure` - Sea level pressure in millibars
* `visib` - Visibility in miles


<!--
* tailnum - Tail number
* year - Year manufactured
* type - Type of plane
* manufacturer - Manufacturer
* model - Model
* engines - Number of engines
* seats - Number of seats
* speed - Average cruising speed in mph
* engine - Type of engine
-->

```{r}
intersect(names(weather), names(flights))
```

## Joining flights and weather {.smaller}

When joining these two data frames I will use an inner join (because I only want the flights that have the weather data, and I only want weather data when there was a flight)

```{r}
(flightsw = inner_join(flights, weather))
```

##

```{r}
plot(flightsw$visib, flightsw$dep_delay)
```

##

```{r}
plot(flightsw$visib, flightsw$dep_delay, log="y", 
     pch=16, cex=0.5, col=adjustcolor("black",0.1))
```

##

```{r}
boxplot(dep_delay~visib,data=flightsw)
```

##

```{r}
filter(flightsw, dep_delay > 0)  %>% 
  boxplot(dep_delay~visib,data=.,log="y")
```

##

```{r}
table(flightsw$visib)
```

## Exercises - Part 2

1. Check some of the other weather variables (e.g. `temp`, `wind_speed`, `etc`) and see if you can find any relationship between them and departure delay (`dep_delay`).

2. Merge the `flights` data with the `planes` data set (pay attention to what columns are being used for the join). Are older planes more likely to be delayed? What about planes from Airbus vs Boeing vs Embraer?
